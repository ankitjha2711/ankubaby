  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

 
  bool amplitude;
  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.

This Arduino sketch reads the state of a push button connected to pin 2 and calculates the amplitude of a sine wave based on the button state. The amplitude value is assigned to the "amplitude" variable, which is a read-write variable in the Arduino IoT Cloud Thing.

The objective of the experiment is to demonstrate how to read the state of a push button and calculate a sine wave amplitude based on the button state, and how to communicate the amplitude value with the Arduino IoT Cloud service.

The architecture of the experiment includes an Arduino board connected to a push button on pin 2, and an IoT Cloud Thing with three variables, "graph", "intensity", and "led", which are automatically updated by the cloud when changes are made to the Thing. The "amplitude" variable is a read-write variable that can be updated from the cloud dashboard or by the Arduino sketch.

The algorithm of the code is as follows:

Initialize serial communication and wait for the serial monitor to open.
Set pin 2 as an input pin.
Initialize the IoT Cloud Thing properties.
Connect to the Arduino IoT Cloud.
Set the debug message level and print debug information.
In the loop function, update the Arduino IoT Cloud service.
Read the state of the push button connected to pin 2.
Calculate the amplitude of the sine wave based on the button state.
Assign the amplitude value to the "amplitude" variable.
If the button is not pressed, set the amplitude value to 0.
