  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  bool pressed;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.

Objective:
The objective of this code is to connect a push button and control a motor based on the button press. When the button is pressed, the motor should turn on, and when it's released, the motor should turn off. This functionality is achieved by communicating the state of the button over the cloud using Arduino IoT Cloud, and then turning the motor on/off based on the received state.

Theory:
The code connects an Arduino board (either ESP or MKR1010) to the Arduino IoT Cloud using the ArduinoCloud.begin() function. It also initializes the properties defined in thingProperties.h using the initProperties() function.

The code sets up the pinMode for the motor output and defines the onPressedChange() function that will be called whenever the state of the button changes.

The onPressedChange() function reads the value of the pressed variable, which represents the state of the button, and turns the motor on or off based on the received state. If the button is pressed, the motor is turned on by calling the analogWrite() function with a value of 255, which sets the motor speed to its maximum. If the button is released, the motor is turned off by calling the analogWrite() function with a value of 0, which sets the motor speed to 0.

Algorithm:

Connect the push button to the Arduino board and the motor to the PWM pin.
Initialize the serial communication and wait for the port to open.
Initialize the cloud properties using the initProperties() function.
Connect to the Arduino IoT Cloud using ArduinoCloud.begin().
Set the debug message level and print debug information using setDebugMessageLevel() and ArduinoCloud.printDebugInfo().
Set the pinMode for the motor output.
Define the onPressedChange() function that will be called whenever the state of the button changes.
In onPressedChange() function, read the value of the pressed variable to determine the state of the button.
If the button is pressed, turn the motor on by calling the analogWrite() function with a value of 255.
If the button is released, turn the motor off by calling the analogWrite() function with a value of 0.
Update the cloud using ArduinoCloud.update() in the loop() function.
Upload the code to the Arduino board and monitor the motor behavior based on the button press.
