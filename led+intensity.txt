  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  float intensity;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.

This is an Arduino sketch designed for the ESP32 microcontroller to interface with the Arduino IoT Cloud platform. The purpose of this experiment appears to be to control the intensity of an output signal using a variable controlled by the cloud.

The sketch initializes a variable called "intensity", which is marked as READ/WRITE in the Arduino IoT Cloud. When the value of this variable changes on the cloud dashboard, the "onIntensityChange()" function is executed, which updates the intensity value in the code and outputs a corresponding analog signal on a pin called "pin2". However, it appears that there is a mistake in the code and the pin being set as an output is actually "pin1".

The architecture of this experiment is based on the ESP32 microcontroller interfacing with the Arduino IoT Cloud platform. The ESP32 is connected to the internet and uses the ArduinoCloud library to establish a connection with the cloud. The cloud dashboard is used to monitor and control the intensity value, which is sent to the ESP32 over the internet.

The algorithm of the code is simple. In the setup() function, the serial communication is initialized, the pinMode for the output pin is set, and the Arduino IoT Cloud connection is established. In the loop() function, the ArduinoCloud.update() function is called to check for updates from the cloud. The onIntensityChange() function is called every time the value of the "intensity" variable changes in the cloud dashboard. This function updates the intensity value in the code and outputs a corresponding analog signal on the "pin2" pin.
Here is the algorithm for the provided code, with a brief explanation of each line:

Include the header file "thingProperties.h" which contains definitions for the variables and functions generated by the Arduino IoT Cloud.
Define a global variable 'pin1' and set it to 2.
In the 'setup' function, initialize the serial communication at a baud rate of 9600, and set a delay of 1500ms to wait for a serial monitor to open. Set 'pin1' as an output pin.
Initialize the properties defined in "thingProperties.h".
Begin the connection to the Arduino IoT Cloud using the preferred connection method specified in the ArduinoIoTPreferredConnection variable.
Set the debug message level to 2, and print the debug information to the serial monitor.
In the 'loop' function, call the 'update' function to check for updates from the Arduino IoT Cloud.
The 'onIntensityChange' function is executed every time a new value is received for the 'intensity' variable from the IoT Cloud. It sets the PWM output of 'pin1' to the received value of 'intensity'.
The main function loop continues to run and waits for further updates from the IoT Cloud.
Overall, the code aims to receive updates for the 'intensity' variable from the Arduino IoT Cloud and set the PWM output of 'pin1' accordingly.
